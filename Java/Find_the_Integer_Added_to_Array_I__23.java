//QUESTION-->
//You are given two arrays of equal length, nums1 and nums2.

// Each element in nums1 has been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable x.

// As a result, nums1 becomes equal to nums2. Two arrays are considered equal when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.

// Return the integer x.

//ANSWER-->
class Solution {
    public int addedInteger(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
                Arrays.sort(nums2);

        int x=nums2[0]-nums1[0];
        return x;
    }
}
